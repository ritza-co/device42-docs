The device **Properties** tab includes sections for **CPU Memory HardDisk**, **Device Operating Systems**, **Connectivity**, **IP Address details**, and **Device Alias**.

Most fields are automatically populated by autodiscovery.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-properties-tab-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-properties-tab-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### CPU Memory HardDisk

<ThemedImage
  alt="CPU Memory and HDD for device"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/cpu-memory-harddisk-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/cpu-memory-harddisk-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

This section holds values for **Total CPUs**, **Cores/CPU**, **CPU Speed**, total **RAM**, and other hard disk drive (HDD) info. If you don't want the CPU and memory values to be changed via autodiscovery, check the **Don't change via api** option.

### Device Operating Systems

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device Operating System fields"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-os-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-os-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

The **OS** name, **OS Version**, and **OS Version #** fields are the basic operating system (OS) details for each device. If EnrichAI is active and the data is available, these fields may be automatically populated by the autodiscovery client. The vendor support details, like the **End of Life** and **End of Support** fields, may also be autopopulated. If EnrichAI is disabled, you can manually enter the relevant data or execute scripts to populate the fields. Note that the **OS License Key** field can also be entered manually. 

The **Count In Licensing** option is checked by default and can be unchecked if it doesn't count towards the OS licensing for the device OS. Check the **Don't change via api** option if you don't want the property values to be changed via autodiscovery.

Note that if the Operating System fields are blank, you may need to rerun autodiscovery.

### Rack Info

Rack information is no longer shown under the device **Properties** tab. To locate the list of physical devices, navigate to **Resources > All Assets**. You can view and edit rack information by clicking on an asset and scrolling to the **Rack Info** section. 

### Connectivity 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Device Operating System fields"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/connectivity-ports-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/connectivity-ports-dark.png'),
  }}
/> 
<br/><br/>

For physical devices, you can add an HWAddress (MAC Address) by clicking on the **+ Add New Connectivity** button and then the **+ Add Port** button in the pop-up window. You can edit the HWAddress by clicking on the blue pen icon or delete it by clicking on the red cross icon beneath the **Action** column. 

### IP Address

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add IP Addresses"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/add-ip-address-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/add-ip-address-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

Add an IP address to the device by clicking the **+ Add another IP/Device relationship** button (1), followed by the **magnifying glass** icon to the right of the created field (2). Select an IP address from the list or click the **+ Add IP Address** button on the top right of the pop-up window. 

Fill in the **IP Address** (3) and **Subnet** (4) information. You can automatically assign the next available IP in that subnet by leaving the **Subnet** field empty. 

If applicable, add additional device associations to the IP address by clicking on the **+ Add another Device association** button (5).

To assign the IP address to the device and MAC address, click on the **Assign/Clear IP** button (6). If an IP is already assigned, upon configuration, the same button will clear the device and MAC relations for that IP and make it available.

### Device Alias and Non-Authoritative Alias

You can add multiple aliases to a device using the **+ Add another Device Alias** button. Select the **Is Preferred** checkbox for one of the aliases. Then, you can click **+ Add another Device Non-Authoritative Alias** to associate nicknames with the device.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add device aliases"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-aliases-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/device-aliases-dark.png'),
  }}
/>
<br/><br/>

Both the device alias and non-authoritative alias add alternate names for the device. You can search for a device using its alias or non-authoritative alias. However, only the alias is used for device matching during an autodiscovery job.

The preferred alias will be the name that appears in device topology maps, impact charts, and dependency charts. The preferred alias is also displayed when adding a device to a business application. 

For example, a device named "0101-DEV01" has the preferred alias "0101-DEV01.gov.it". 

- The preferred alias is displayed on the topology map:

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Topology with device alias"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/topology-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/topology-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

- When adding a device to a business application, you can search for that device with the device name, but the preferred alias is the name that will display on the chart.

  Business Application device search:

  <ThemedImage

    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-application-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-application-dark.png'),
    }}
  />

  Business Application chart:

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Business Application with device"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-app-device-light.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/device-properties/business-app-device-dark.png'),
    }}
  />
