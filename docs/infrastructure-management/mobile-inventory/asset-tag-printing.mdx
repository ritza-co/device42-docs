Print QR code and barcode asset tags from Device42 using a compatible label printer.

## Supported Printers

Device42 supports the Brother QL700 label printer. Any label printer that can print at 300x600 dpi should work (300x300 dpi may result in lower quality).

**Recommended labels:**
- **QR Codes:** Brother DK-2211 (50' roll, 1-1/7" width, black on white)
- **Barcodes:** Brother DK-2212 (50' roll, 2.42" width, black on white)

These products are available in the US from online and in store merchants including Amazon and Staples. We would love to hear feedback from international customers' and their experience.
