Install and launch the Mac Agent service launcher by following these steps:

1. Download the Signed Mac Agent as described in the [Signed Mac Agent](signed-mac-agent.mdx) docs.
2. Download the `.plist` file from the [Device42 Autodiscovery tools page](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/) under **MacOS Service Wrapper for the Discovery Agent**.
3. Modify the `.plist` file as required based on your setup and required options. For example, you can change the `StartInterval` to configure how often the agent will run, or configure other options to pass as `ProgramArguments`.
4. You need the config file and executable in the `/opt/device42/` directory.
5. You need the `.plist` file in the `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` directory.

Now run:

```
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/<plist file name>
```

## Make Changes to the `.plist` File

If you make changes to the `.plist` file, you need to `unload` and then `load` it again by running:

```
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/<plist file name>
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/<plist file name>
```

To make sure that the file is correctly loaded, run:

```
sudo launchctl list | grep device42
```

## Install via MDM

If you need to deploy in bulk to many machines, you can use MDM. 

Package the Launch Agent using Composer and deploy it via the JSS, Casper Remote, or ARD.

Include the following as a post-flight script to set some permissions and load the agent. Right-click **Scripts**, click **Shell Script**, and then **post flight**.

```
#!/bin/bash
chown root "/Library/LaunchDaemons/NAMEOF.plist"
chmod 644 "/Library/LaunchDaemons/NAMEOF.plist"
launchctl load "/Library/LaunchDaemons/NAMEOF.plist"
```

## Notes

- By default, logs are stored under `/var/log` or as otherwise configured in the `.plist` file.
- The `agent_local.log` file is under the default `/opt/device42` working directory.
