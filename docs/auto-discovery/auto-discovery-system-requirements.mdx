title: "Autodiscovery System Requirements"

The following are prerequisites and other general requirements and guidelines for successful discovery and optimum performance:

- Create users with the required access.
- Identify the IP discovery scope (ranges) of interest. 
- If you aren't using IPv6, it's advisable to choose the **Ignore IPv6** option when configuring discovery jobs.
- The minimum system resource configuration for the Device42 appliance is 4 CPUs and 8 GB of memory. 
- Ensure a 1 Gbps minimum network connection, a dedicated resource pool for the Device42 VM, and that there are no resource contention issues. 
- Placing the Device42 Appliance's (Virtual Machine) VHD on an SSD is ideal but not required.
- WinRM Windows discovery can be run from the Main Appliance or a Remote Collector. Deploy remote collector(s) to the desired network segments and select them when configuring your discovery jobs where appropriate.
- To _(optionally)_ exclude known service port ranges from discovery, go to **Tools > Settings > Global Settings > Win/\*nix Exclusions** and add your exclusions to the autodiscovery application. This limits the scope and volume of data that is discovered, helping to reduce noise and overhead while shortening the overall discovery time.
- Ignore certain IP and MAC addresses for all jobs by creating an exclusion for it under **Tools > Settings > Global Settings > Win/\*nix Exclusions**. The devices will still be discovered, but the details are dropped from ingestion.

:::caution
Do not set up an autodiscovery scan using critical production account credentials! Please create a separate, dedicated account to use only for discovery.

Account lock-out could result in an otherwise avoidable outage depending on your permissions and configured password policies. You as a customer are responsible for any such behavior.

## Platform-Specific Permissions

See detailed permission information for OS platforms:

- Windows and WMI namespace: [Windows and HyperV Discovery](/auto-discovery/windows-and-hyper-v-auto-discovery.mdx) page.
- Linux and Sudo usage details: [Linux and Unix Server Discovery](/auto-discovery/linux-unix-server-auto-discovery.mdx) page.

Contact [support@device42.com](mailto:support@device42.com) with any questions regarding specific privilege level requirements for WMI Namespaces and *nix commands run with or without Sudo.

## Ports and Protocols Used By Discovery

See [Discovery Port Configurations](/getstarted/deploy-device42/discovery-port-configurations.mdx) for a complete list.
