## The Device42 Remote Collector

A Remote Collector (RC) is a virtual appliance deployed separately from the Device42 Main Appliance (MA). An RC is controlled from the MA and sent autodiscovery jobs that it executes remotely. All autodiscovery jobs, including Power SNMP jobs, are supported and can be run remotely on an RC.

:::note
Windows discovery requires at least one [Windows Discovery Service](getstarted/deploy-device42/windows-discovery-service-installation.mdx) (WDS) instance to be deployed.
:::

You may configure an unlimited number of RC appliances as needed across your environment. RCs facilitate SNMP, IPMI, hypervisor, and other types of autodiscovery across networks requiring only HTTPS access, eliminating the need to open numerous ports across network segments.

### Sizing Recommendations

For one RC per 1000 workloads, the sizing recommendations are as follows:

- Two vCPU
- 4GB RAM
- 50GB vDisk

## Running Remote Discoveries

Once registered, you can schedule any autodiscovery job from the MA and instruct it to run on the RC of your choosing. Each autodiscovery screen shows a **Remote Collector** dropdown menu. Click this dropdown to display all registered RCs and choose the RC you would like to run the discovery job:

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/select-rc-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

## View and Edit Remote Collectors

Open the Device42 website in your browser. Click the RC **Name** on the **Remote Collectors** list page to view or edit a specific RC. Click the **Edit** button to edit the RC.

Note that the view and edit pages now include a **MAC Address** field showing the address of the RC. Be careful editing this address; an incorrect address will cause the RC to disconnect.

  }}
/>

### Remote Collector List Page Actions

Navigate to the **Remote Collectors** list page under **Discovery > Remote Collectors** and click **Actions**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/rc-actions-menu-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Select the relevant RC(s) from the table, choose one of the following actions, and click the **hammer icon** to execute the action:

- **Delete with Detailed Confirmation**: Delete the selected RC(s) with a confirmation prompt.
- **Export Selected Items as CSV**: Export a CSV file with information about the selected RC(s).
- **Clear logs**: Clear the log files for the selected RC(s).
- **Reboot Collectors**: Reboot the selected connected RC(s). Note that if your RC is exhibiting unusual behavior, rebooting the RC is a good first step to resolving the problem.
- **Set Logging Level**: Set the RC logging level. Select **Information** to reduce the log file size. You can also set a Global Logging Level via the RC console.
- **Set Proxy Settings**: Edit the RC(s) inherited proxy settings.

## Installation and Configuration

See the [Remote Collector Installation page](/getstarted/deploy-device42/remote-collector-rc-installation.mdx) for installation and configuration instructions.
