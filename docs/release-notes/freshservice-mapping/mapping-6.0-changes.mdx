The following two changes to the `mapping.xml` file were made as part of the Cloud Connector 5.2.0 release (CC 5.2.0).

If you are using a custom `mapping.xml` file, you need to manually apply these updates. See [Manage Customization with Newer Releases](/integration/external-integrations/freshservice-integration/customize-freshservice#manage-customization-with-newer-releases).

## Change to the Azure Network Interface Task 

Regarding this Azure Network Interface task:

```html
<task enable="true" name="D42 Azure Network Interface to Freshservice Azure Network Interface" type="asset" description="Copy Azure Network Interface from Device42 to Freshservice" d42_min_version="19.04.00">
```

The DOQL `SELECT` statement of the `<resource>` element was changed from:

```sql
netport.details ->> 'mac_address'               AS mac_address,
```

To the following:

```sql
netport.hwaddress                               AS mac_address,
```

## Additional Tasks Added

Two tasks were added to delete software installations that no longer exist in Device42:

```xml
<task enable="true" type="software_installation" description="Delete software installations from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42" d42_min_version="16.19.00">
<task enable="true" type="software_installation" description="Delete software installations from Freshservice that do not exist in Device42" d42_max_version="16.18.02">
```
