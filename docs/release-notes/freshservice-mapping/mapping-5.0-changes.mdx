The following changes to the `mapping.xml` file are part of the Cloud Connector 5.1.2 release (CC 5.1.2).

If you are using a custom mapping.xml file, you need to manually apply these updates. See [Manage Customization with Newer Releases](/integration/external-integrations/freshservice-integration/customize-freshservice#manage-customization-with-newer-releases).

## Obsolete Field Attributes Removed

The following field element attributes were removed from all field mappings because null and blank values are no longer sent to Freshservice by default.

- `not-null`
- `skip-if-null`
- `set-space`

## Examples

The examples below show field elements with these attributes removed.

### Example 1: `set-space` Attribute Removed

       ```

- Version 5.0:

       ```xml
       <field resource="name" source-type="string" target="name" target-type="string" target-header="General"

       ```
