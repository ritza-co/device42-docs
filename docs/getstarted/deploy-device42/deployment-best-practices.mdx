When deploying Device42 in a production environment, it's important to conform to common application hardening best practices. Many of these are industry standards for any production application. The following sections outline these best practices within the context of Device42.

## Change Passwords For Default Credentials

On the Main Appliance (MA), change the following default credentials:

1. **System Console User:** Default Credentials: `device42` | `adm!nd42`
2. **Web GUI Admin User:** Default Credentials: `admin` | `adm!nd42`
3. **Appliance Manager:** Default Credentials: `d42admin` | `default`

:::note
    The admin account can also be disabled entirely (though you will need at least one superuser active on the appliance).
:::

If you are deploying through the AWS or Azure marketplaces, then the passwords above are not the default values used. Review the below documentation for more information:

- [Amazon Web Services – Installation](installation-guides/installation-amazon-web-services.mdx)
- [Microsoft Azure – Installation](installation-guides/installation-microsoft-azure.mdx)

On the Remote Collector (RC), change the System Console User (Default Credentials: `client` | `device42`).

There are no Device42-configured credentials for the Windows Discovery Service (WDS).

## Practice Good Password Hygiene

**Set a strong passphrase for the secrets vault.** Device42 has a built-in password/secrets vault and all secrets are encrypted using AES 256-bit encryption. Encryption is based on a passphrase entered by the user. (One-time setup and you would need to secure the passphrase in case you need to restore the backup). This passphrase should ideally be random and as long as possible.

**Use burnt secrets whenever possible.** A "burnt secret" is simply a way to store a password and designate it as unretrievable. If a password is set to "burnt", it can never be retrieved after being stored but Device42 can use it for discovery.

**Manage password access.** If passwords must be stored in a viewable manner, limit access whenever possible. Consider creating custom groups to limit users who can view secrets.

Passwords can have individual permissions to further restrict who can view, edit, and use them. See the documentation below for more information:

- [Password security and permissions](administration/passwords/password-security-and-permissions.mdx)
- [Set default password management group](administration/passwords/set-default-password-management-group.mdx)
- [Leverage password policies](administration/passwords/password-policy.mdx) to ensure that Device42 users have:
  - Cryptographically strong passwords (that is, minimum counts of numeric, special, and uppercase letter characters)
  - Password expiration dates
  - Maximum number of invalid login attempts

## Restrict Access

Restrict access using groups with functional and object permissions. Device42 includes role-based access control capabilities to restrict the actions and objects that users or groups can interact with.

Whenever possible it is recommended to take the least-privilege approach. For example, when creating dedicated users for API access, limit their actions to read-only if that is all that is required.

Users can also have staff access revoked, meaning they can only interact with the API and can't log in via the GUI.

Limit the number of active superusers on the Main Appliance whenever feasible.

## Obfuscate Appliance Access

Device42 should only be deployed in private networks and should never be allocated a public IP address directly. SaaS-based integrations do not require public internet access, as the MA leverages the [cloud connector](integration/external-integrations/device42-cloud-connector-overview.mdx) for outbound communication.

If you are considering a dedicated public IP address, reach out to support@device42.com to discuss your use case. If you must expose Device42 to the public internet, ensure that:

- All default credentials have been changed.
- Access to management ports is restricted, including port 404 (SSH access to the MA) and ports 4242/4343 (HTTP/HTTPS access to the appliance manager).

To further protect your MA, you can configure a proxy for outbound HTTP/HTTPS connections in the **Global Settings** section of the appliance manager.

## Additional Security Configurations

The following settings can further strengthen your Device42 deployment.

### Disable older TLS versions if not required

By default, the appliance is configured to use TLS v.1.2 only but it is always good to double-check your current configuration.

From the Appliance Manager, you can see which TLS versions are enabled by navigating to **Global Settings -> TLS versions for Web Console** and **TLS versions for Appliance Manager**.

### Disable HTTP access

By default, Device42 will upgrade HTTP connections to HTTPS however HTTP access can be disabled entirely. 
  
From the Appliance Manager, disable HTTP access in **Global Settings -> Enable/Disable HTTP for Web Console** and **Appliance Manager SSL**.

### Import an HTTPS certificate

You can add your own HTTPS certificate and key file to further secure the web console. See [Set Up HTTPS Cert](administration/appliance-manager/set-up-https-cert.mdx) for more information.

### Set inactivity timeouts for user sessions

Device42 provides global inactivity timeouts to kill stale sessions.

- You can configure separate timeout values for general GUI access and access to the Appliance Manager. Check your currently configured timeout values by navigating to **Global Settings -> Set Inactivity logout time** from the Appliance Manager.
- You can also configure a separate timeout value for the secrets vault. The secrets timeout is configured from the web GUI under **Tools -> Global Settings -> Secrets**.

### Set up authentication

If you already leverage a SAML 2.0 provider that enforces 2FA or MFA (like Okta or OneLogin), consider setting up a [SAML 2.0 Configuration](administration/saml-2-0-configuration.mdx).

In addition to SAML, Device42 can be configured to use Active Directory for authentication. See [Active Directory / LDAP User Sync](auto-discovery/active-directory-sync.mdx) for more information.

### Check audit history events

Device42 stores audit history events. Any login events or modifications to objects in the database are stored and retained for a configurable duration.

Consider adjusting the **Days to Keep logs** setting from **Tools -> Log Settings** in the web GUI.

You may also choose to offload these events to an external log collection tool like Splunk to keep them for historical purposes. See [Splunk Integration with Device42](https://www.device42.com/integrations/splunk/) for more information on the Splunk integration.
