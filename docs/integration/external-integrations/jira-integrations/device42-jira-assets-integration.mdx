Integrate your Device42 instance with Atlassian Jira Service Management (JSM) Cloud to benefit from our autodiscovery capabilities and have your latest IT management information available.

:::warning
Please note that [the JSM Assets app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?query=device42) is the currently supported Device42-Jira integration app. It is available on the Atlassian Marketplace.

Support for the 'external' JSM Assets integration app [ended on December 30, 2024](https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/shutdown-notice-update-on-deprecation-of-the-external-assets-platform/81193), as Atlassian has implemented asset capabilities that are 'internal' (native) to its premium Jira platform. 
:::

The instructions below describe the initial setup process of integrating Device42 with your JSM Cloud account.

## Integrate Device42 and Jira Service Management

With just a few minutes of setup, your Device42-Jira integration will allow you to link assets between the two systems.

### Prerequisites

This integration requires that you have:

* Admin privileges to a running Device42 virtual appliance [Update your software](https://device42.com/update/) or [download a free trial](https://device42.com/download/).
* A Jira Service Management Cloud Premium or Enterprise account.
* A network setup that allows the browser to access `jsm.device42.io`. Ensure outbound communication is not blocked by WAF or other network and security controls.

### Configure Cloud Services

We'll start by preparing Device42 for cloud service integrations. Navigate to **Tools > Integrations > Cloud Services**, and complete the following fields:

* **D42 URL for SaaS apps:** This is the hostname your Device42 instance is accessible on.
* **Company Name:** Your company name.
* **Email:** Your email address.
