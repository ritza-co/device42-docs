Secrets are credentials saved to Device42. Permissions can be assigned to each Secret for specific Users, Admin Groups, or both. 

Navigate to the Secrets list page from **Resources > Secrets > All Secrets**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/secret-security-permissions/all-secrets-menu-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Global Permissions

You can grant Admin Groups global permission(s) to **add**, **view**, **change**, or **delete** Secrets. This controls whether users will be able to add new Secrets, view Secrets in the list page, or access the edit and delete buttons. Permissions are controlled granularly for individual Secrets (see below).

Note that you can't assign global permissions directly to a User (Administrator), you'll need to add them to an Admin Group.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Admin Group permissions"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/secret-security-permissions/group-secret-permissions-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/secret-security-permissions/group-secret-permissions-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

The following Admin Group permissions are available:

- **Add permission** allows users to create new Secrets.

- **View / Change permission** is needed to view the secret in the menu, but the permission is controlled granularly for each Secret. So, globally you can assign the view/change permission to a group, but it would not give that group permission to view/edit specific Secrets. It would only enable them to see the Secret.

- **Delete permission** is required to see the delete button, but again individual permission to delete a Secret is controlled by permissions granted on that Secret. If a user can change a Secret, they can also delete that Secret.

### Permissions for Individual Secrets

You can set permissions to **view**, **use**, and/or **edit** individual Secrets by creating or editing a Secret. 

Each permission can be applied to two user categories - individual Users and Admin Groups - for a total of six options:

- **View Users**: set Users who can _view_ the Secret (pictured).
- **View Groups**: set Admin Groups who can _view_ the Secret (pictured).
- **Use Only Users**: set Users who can only _use_ the Secret.
- **Use Only Groups**: set Admin Groups who can only _use_ the Secret.
- **View edit users**:  set Users who can _view and change_ the Secret.
- **View edit groups**: set Admin Groups who can _view and change_ the Secret.

<ThemedImage
  alt="View User Permission"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/secret-security-permissions/view-users-permission-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/secret-security-permissions/view-users-permission-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }}
/>

<ThemedImage
  alt="View Group Permission"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/secret-security-permissions/view-groups-permission-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/secret-security-permissions/view-groups-permission-dark.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '80%' }}
/>

At least one User or Admin Group should have permission to edit a Secret. Otherwise, a password might become inaccessible.

If no permissions are entered, the User who created the Secret will have **view / edit** permission by default.

### Bulk Permissions Change

From the Secrets list page, you can edit group permissions of many Secrets at once by selecting **Change group permissions for selected passwords** from the **Actions** dropdown menu. Click the **hammer icon** to execute the action.

  }}

### Secret Storage Details

- Secrets are stored using AES-256-bit encryption.
- Encryption is gated on a passphrase set up by the user. You need to securely record the passphrase in case you need to restore the backup.
- Secrets are stored in the database in an encrypted state and go to the backup file in that state. The backup file is also encrypted by a user-entered passphrase. Neither of these passphrases is included in the backup.
- All change/add/delete/view operations are logged in an audit trail.
- After one minute of inactivity on a password page the session will timeout.
- A global timeout value controls the overall timeout for any session and is set in the Appliance Manager.
- Secrets aren't displayed in the Secret list page by default. Click on the eye icon next to the Secret to display it.
