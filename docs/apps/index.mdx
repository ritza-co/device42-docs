## What is Application Dependency Mapping?

Application Dependency Mapping (ADM) builds insightful models of your IT services and applications.

ADM consists of the following Device42 features that together offer the complete ADM package:

- [ADM-enabled discovery](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/configure-application-dependency-mapping.mdx#creating-a-discovery-job)
- [Application Components](/apps/application-components/)
- [Application Groups](/apps/application-groups)
- [Business Services](/apps/business-services)

## Best Practices Overview

The order of documentation subsections follows that of the ADM best practices, which is explained in more detail on the [Application Dependency Mapping](enterprise-application-dependency-mapping.index) page.

The ADM order of operations is:

1. Run OS-level discovery jobs with ADM enabled. See [Configure ADM](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/configure-application-dependency-mapping.mdx)
2. **[Application Components](application-components/)** are discovered components such as databases, web servers, and load balancers. See a complete list of Device42’s supported applications here: **[ADM supported applications](apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-supported-applications)**. For applications not on the list, you need to configure Templates to get Device42 to find the services associated with the missing applications and create Application Components them.
3. View the discovered services in your environment. See the [All Services](/apps/services/index.mdx) and [Service Instances](/apps/services/service-instances.mdx) pages for details on how services relate to ADM.

    }}
    />

4. **[Application Groups](/apps/application-groups/index.mdx)** (previously known as Affinity Groups) offer an opinionated view of the impactful applications and their dependencies in your environment.
5. **[Business Services](business-services/)** allow you to design and customize your map of critical business functions based on the Application Groups you choose.

## ADM Features

- **Discover services–to-services mapping**: Device42 can show you which service on a machine or instance is connected to which other service(s) on other machines.
- **Grab the configuration data for major applications**: You are able to see config details (and for some software, the actual configuration file contents) of certain applications from within Device42. These applications include Oracle, Microsoft SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cold Fusion, IIS, Apache HTTPD, and more.
- **Automate Periodic Sampling Jobs**: You can automate Periodic Jobs for both port and database connections to gain a comprehensive view of applications as you use these resources over time. This will enhance the discovery beyond a point-in-time usage.
- **Automate Application Component grouping**: You can automatically add Application Components based on groupings of services on a server. For example, once Device42 discovers different Oracle services running on a machine, it will automatically group those services together as an Oracle application.
