[Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)](https://www.device42.com/features/application-mappings/) is a separately licensed Device42 component that maps and provides insight about how your applications and infrastructure work together in your IT environment. 

At it's core, ADM is built on relationship information collected between servers over time (known as a sampling interval) using Netstat. More broadly, ADM includes Device42 Discovery, Application Components, Application Groups, and Business Services. 

The best practice workflow for getting the most out of ADM goes in a order of operations visualized below and outlined in the sections that follow.

1. Discovery and Services
2. Application Groups
3. Business Services

### Discovery, Services, and Service Communication

Build up the dataset used to map applications using four categories:

- Run ADM and Netflow sampling
- Discover load balancers 
- Discover databases
- Facilitate Device42's creation of Application Components by configuring Templates. Consult the Service Instance list page for values to use when configuring Templates, like "Path Args".

(Services vs Service Communication?)

### Business Services

After you have performed a successful autodiscovery of your environment, you can view all the discovered Application Dependency data under the **Applications** section in the Device42 main menu.

  }}

These sections cover the following entries found in the **Applications** menu of the Device42 Main Appliance. Explore these categories in the docs using the sidebar on the left.

- **[Application Dependency Mapping](enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/)** provides information about the autodiscovery of application and service dependencies throughout a network.
- **[Application Components](application-components/)** are discovered components such as databases, web servers, and load balancers. See a complete list of Device42’s supported applications here: **[ADM supported applications](apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-supported-applications)**.
- **[Application Groups](/apps/application-groups/index.mdx)** (previously known as Affinity Groups) offer an opinionated view of the impactful applications and their dependencies in your environment.
:::tip
Get started with Application Groups by defining the Starting Point in a [Calculation Rule](application-groups/calculation-rules), running one of the predefined rules, and accepting Application Group Suggestions.
:::
- **[Business Services](business-services/)** allow you to design and customize your map of critical business functions.

The [Services](services/index.mdx) section provides details on each of the **Services** options available in the Main Appliance **Resources** menu.
