Build insightful models of your IT services and applications.

## What is Application Dependency Mapping?

Application Dependency Mapping (ADM) is a separately licensed Device42 component that maps communication between applications and infrastructure, showing you how they work together in your IT environment. 

At it's core, ADM is built on service-to-service communication information, represented as 'listeners' and 'clients', collected over time using Netstat. 

ADM consists of the following Device42 features that together offer the complete ADM package:

- [ADM-enabled discovery](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/configure-application-dependency-mapping.mdx#creating-a-discovery-job)
- [Application Components](/apps/application-components/)
- [Application Groups](/apps/application-groups)
- [Business Services](/apps/business-services)

## ADM Features

- **Discover services–to-services mapping**: Device42 can show you which service on a machine or instance is connected to which other service(s) on other machines.
- **Grab the configuration data for major applications**: You are able to see config details (and for some software, the actual configuration file contents) of certain applications from within Device42. These applications include Oracle, Microsoft SQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cold Fusion, IIS, Apache HTTPD, and more.
- **Automate Periodic Sampling Jobs**: You can automate Periodic Jobs for both port and database connections to gain a comprehensive view of applications as you use these resources over time. This will enhance the discovery beyond a point-in-time usage.
- **Automate Application Component grouping**: You can automatically add Application Components based on groupings of services on a server. For example, once Device42 discovers different Oracle services running on a machine, it will automatically group those services together as an Oracle application.

## ADM Best Practices Overview

The order of documentation subsections follows that of the ADM best practices. Each step is explained in more detail on the [Application Dependency Mapping](enterprise-application-dependency-mapping.index) page.

After the initial discovery without ADM, work in order from top to bottom and left to right – run ADM-enabled discovery jobs, optionally enabling Netflow sampling, and finally ending with Business Services.

1. Run Windows and *nix discovery jobs with ADM and service features turned off. This will help
you be resourceful with licenses by helping you determine the specific application servers you wish to perform the deeper level of Services and Application Component discovery on. 
2. Run OS-level discovery jobs with ADM enabled. See [Configure ADM](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/configure-application-dependency-mapping.mdx) for the detailed setup.
3. Verify the discovered data. 
4. **[Application Components](application-components/)** are discovered components such as databases, web servers, and load balancers. See a complete list of Device42’s supported applications here: **[ADM supported applications](apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-supported-applications)**. For applications not on the list, you need to configure Templates to get Device42 to find the services associated with the missing applications and create Application Components them.
5. View the discovered services in your environment. See the [All Services](/apps/services/index.mdx) and [Service Instances](/apps/services/service-instances.mdx) pages for details on how services relate to ADM.

    }}
    />

6. Configure **[Application Groups](/apps/application-groups/index.mdx)** (previously known as Affinity Groups). Application Groups offer an opinionated view of the impactful applications and their dependencies in your environment.
7. Create a **[Business Service](business-services/)** to solidify your understanding of an application and create referenceable documentation. Design and customize your map of critical business functions based on the Application Groups you choose. 

## Licensing

In addition to signing up for **Enterprise Application Discovery** and **Services Discovery** (collectively called 'ADM licenses'), 

<ThemedImage
  alt="ADM licenses"

    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-licenses-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-licenses-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

You may optionally obtain a Netflow license and [enable Netflow](/auto-discovery/netflow-collector/) on your Remote Collector. 

If you need to upgrade your license, contact the support team for more information at [support@device42.com.](mailto:support@device42.com).
