This page outlines the best practices roadmap in more detail of configuring to get the best out of this powerful Device42 feature.

## ADM Best Practice Workflow

See [ADM Best Practices Overview](/apps/) for an outline of the workflow detailed below.

### Initial Discovery without ADM

Discover your Windows and/or Linux environment.

Begin by running Windows and *nix discovery jobs with ADM features turned off. You can also identify Windows and *nix systems on selected networks by running a [TCP Port Scan job](/auto-discovery/tcp-port-scan-auto-discovery.mdx).

We recommend running initial discovery with ADM turned off to be resourceful with licenses. In most cases, your ADM licenses are not equal to your Core licenses, resulting in ADM licenses being allocated to servers that are not part of the Application inventory.

ADM is enabled by default on discovery jobs when you have ADM licenses enabled. Turn off ADM services on the discovery job form:

- Set **ADM Sampling Interval** to **Off**.

    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-off-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Under the **Software and Applications** section, unselect the **Discover Services** and **Discover Applications** checkboxes.

  }}
/>

### ADM Discovery, Application Components, and Service Communication

Begin by configuring and running discovery jobs:

1. Identify the Windows and *Nix application servers in your environment to target, create and run ADM-enabled discovery jobs for the target servers.
2. Create and run load balancer discovery jobs.
3. Create and run database discovery jobs.
4. From the Operating-System-level discovery run, Device42 creates Application Components – building blocks for mapping application relationships. Identify any missing applications in the list of Application Components that Device42 has created: 
    - Check if [the list of commonly supported applications](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/adm-supported-applications.mdx) (and their services) includes the applications you use. 
    - Visit the Device42 Main appliance, go to **Applications > Application Components** and check if all the applications you expect are listed. 

5. Get Device42 to create Application Components of the missing applications with Application Component Templates:
    - Go to **Resources > Service Instances** and view Service Instances details to use as values that can be matched against to find the missing application when creating the Template.
    - Configure an Application Component Template, which allows Device42 to find and create an Application Component for the missing application services. 

### Application Groups

Application Groups (**Applications > Application Groups**) are the map of your services and applications and how they communicate. 

Device42 generates Applications Group Suggestions based on collected relationship data and your input in the form of Calculation Rules and Logic Templates.

Accepting informative Application Group Suggestions moves them to the **My Application Groups** tab. These Application Groups progress to Business Services.

Application Groups offer many insights:
- For example, you can identify devices communicating with, and dependent on, core servers via a service, such as development or test servers.
- Identify servers added to an Application without being documented.
- See how an application in your environment has changed over time.
- Get a deeper understanding of what service is creating a relationship in an Application Group.

Application Groups are dynamic. New discoverd data from your environment will update Application Groups.

### Business Services

Business Services are used to solidify your understanding of an Application gathered from examining its Application group and create referenceable documentation.

Unlike Application Groups, Business Services are static and will not change unless you have created an [Alert](/reports/reports/setup-alerts-and-notifications.mdx) for added and removed dependencies.

Create a Business Service (under **Applications > Business Services**) by adding a Application Group to the Business Service.
