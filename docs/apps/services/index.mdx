Use the **All Services** list page to see which services are running across your infrastructure and how many instances of each exist. View widely-deployed applications and noisy monitoring agents.

- Select the **Discover Services** option when you create a discovery job to discover services.

## Application Dependency Mapping and Services

For [Application Dependency Mapping (ADM)](/apps/index.mdx), reviewing **All Services** and [**Service Instances**](service-instances.mdx) of the Device42 Main Appliance is particularly useful.

### All Services vs Service Instances

The All Services list page has records of the unique names of the discovered services and the number of **Service Instances** with that name. For example:

- `15` instances of `java`
- `8` instances of `java.exe`

Identify noisy services, like agents, from the All Services list page by sorting the **Service Instances** column from high to low count.

The Service Instances list page stores every discovered service as an individual entry, with the **Device** it's running on and [other details](service-instances.mdx). For example:

- `java.exe` running on device `jboss-27`
- `java.exe` running on device `jboss-29`
