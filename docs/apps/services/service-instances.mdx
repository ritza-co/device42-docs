Each discovered service is stored as an entry in the Service Instance list page under **Resources > Service Instances**. You'll see multiple services with the same **Service Name**. If you want a tally of the number of services with the same name, visit the [All Services](/apps/services/index.mdx) list page under **Resources > All Services**.

A Service Instance record includes the service **Device**, its **State**, **Service Path**, **Listener Addresses**, and **Ports**.

## Using the Service Instances Interface

From **Resources > Service Instances**, click on a **Service Name** to view or edit that instance.

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/service-instance-list-page-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/service-instance-list-page-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Service Instances Actions

Select one or more Service Instances and select an option from the **Actions** menu to perform on the selection.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Service Instance Actions menu"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/service-instances-actions-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/service-instances-actions-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

### Add a Service Instance

Click **Create** to add a new instance.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Add Service Instance form"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/add-service-instance-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/add-service-instance-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Click **Service** to select the service you want to add. Device42 displays the Select Service dialog – you can also add a new component from this dialog. 
- Select the **Start Mode**, **State**, and **Topology Status**. 

Enter or select any other information you want for the instance, and then click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

## Application Dependency Mapping and Service Instances

As part of the [Application Dependency Mapping (ADM) workflow](/apps/enterprise-application-dependency-mapping/index.mdx), Device42 creates Application Components (**Applications > Application Components**) from discovered data and services. Application Components are building blocks for creating Application Groups and then ultimately a Business Service. 

If you have an application that is absent or not quite captured as an Application Component, after running OS-level discovery jobs with ADM sampling enabled, create an Application Component Template to instruct Device42 on what to look for.

The **Service Command Args** value of a Service Instance can be used as match criteria when configuring the Application Component Template you need. 

- Copy the **Service Command Args** value of a Service Instance. 

<ThemedImage
  alt="Service Instance Example"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/service-instances-args-example-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/service-instances-args-example-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

- Create a new Application Component Template using the previous Service Instance **Service Command Args** value as match criteria:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Application Component Template"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/app-comp-template-arg-light.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/assets/images/service-instances/app-comp-template-arg-dark.png'),
  }}
/>

Creating Application Component Templates for Java.exe applications is particularly useful - you provide the command line switches (**Service Command Args**) containing the launch details of the service.
