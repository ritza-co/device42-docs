### Add a Service Communication

Click **Create** from the Service Communications list page to add a new communication.

  }}
/>

Enter a Client IP Address, Listener IP Address. Port, and Protocol. You can also select the Client Device, Listener Device, and enter a Client process display name and a Client process name. Click Save at the bottom of the page to ad the service communication.

### Service Port IP Statistics

Select **Resources > Services > Service Communications** and click on a record **ID** to view service port IP statistics. 

Statistics are only kept from a listener perspective and are client-IP-centric (not per client service). Collected statistics appear in the **Classic Statistics** section of this page. See below for descriptions of the Netstat and Netflow statistics Device42 collects.

    <tr>
      <td width="360"><strong>Formula</strong></td>
      <td width="360"><strong>Description</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td width="360">Netstat Active Samples / Netstat Total Samples * 100</td>
      <td width="360">Persistence of connection. Percentage of time that a connection is found when this listener is active. This last part is important as D42 only increments Total Samples when D42 actually discovers the listener. So if a service is only running on weekends for example, D42 doesn't affect the client percentage time during weekdays. So a service could still be connected 100% of the time if every time D42 found this service listening, it also saw this connection, even if the service was only listening 15% of the time.</td>

#### Time Span Notes

For the two time spans – _Netflow Client Active Span_ and _Netflow Client Gap Span_ – these are heavily affected by your sample period. So if you sample every 1 minutes, D42 will consider a connection active as long as D42 sees two communications within this 1 minute period, even if between samples. Consider this example:

**Sample File 1:**

_Communication A `<=>` B at 12:01:15 AM_

_Communication A `<=>` B at 12:01:45 AM_

**Sample File 2:**

_Communication A `<=>` B at 12:02:10 AM_

_Communication A `<=>` B at 12:02:45 AM_

**Sample File 3:**

_Communication A `<=>` B at 12:03:50 AM_

_Communication A `<=>` B at 12:03:55 AM_

**Results for A `<=>` B stats are:**

Active Samples: 3

Total Events: 6

First Found :12:01:15 AM

Last Found: 12:03:55 AM

Active Span: 1 Min 40 sec

Gap Span: 1 Min 5 Sec (This is the gap between 12:02:45 AM and 12:03:50 AM since it is longer than the sample interval.)

Also note that D42 doesn't count the remaining 5 seconds of the last internal until D42 gets the next sample file. Once D42 gets that, it will either count those 5 seconds as a gap or as active based on when the next _A `<=>` B_ match appears.
